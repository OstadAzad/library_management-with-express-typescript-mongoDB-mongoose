  "isbn": "9780553380163",
  "description": "An overview of cosmology and black holes.",
  "copies": 5,
  "available": true
}

Borrow Book (POST /api/borrow)
{
  "book": "64ab3f9e2a4b5c6d7e8f9012",
  "quantity": 2,
  "dueDate": "2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"
}

Response Structure
Success response example:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Book created successfully",
  "data": { ... }
}
Error response example:
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "success": false,
  "error": { ... }
}

Business Logic Highlights
Borrowing books verifies if requested quantity is available

Copies of the book are deducted accordingly

When copies reach 0, available flag is set to false automatically

Book availability updated through Mongoose instance method and middleware

Borrow records are saved with reference to book, quantity, and due date

Aggregation Endpoint
GET /api/borrow returns a summary of total borrowed quantity per book with:

Book title

Book ISBN

Total quantity borrowed
